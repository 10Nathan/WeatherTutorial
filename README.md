https://github.com/10Nathan/WeatherTutorial

Description: I-Weather is a weather application that is designed to enable uses to save trips. It will get the users current location and use it to provide information about weather in their area. Depending on selected location and current weather certain features of the application will change. The user will be able to select routes (source â€“ destination) using a map that is provided by a Bing Map API. The application will gather weather data about their selected route using Open Weather Maps API. The weather data will be presented to the user so that they can prepare for their route.
